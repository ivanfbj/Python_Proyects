Python Mad Libs Generator
The objective of this project is to develop a Mad Libs Generator python project. In this project,
the user first has to pick a story by the title of the story. Then the user has to enter specific words like a noun,
adverb, verb, food, adjective, etc, according to the requirements. And then the story will be generated.

This is a python project for absolute beginners and is developed using the basic concept of python and tkinter.

"""
Summary
We have successfully developed the mad libs generator python project. We used tkinter library for rendering graphics
on a display window and learn how to create buttons widget and pass the function to the button. In this way,
we build this python project.
